# Binary Decoder Written in C++

This version is identical in function to the version written in Python.  
This program was compiled on Linux, thus will only run on Linux.
To run it, navigate to the directory in which the executable is stored, and run:  
`./binary-decoder`  
then enter a binary number to decode.  
Please note this is my first C++ program, so my code my not follow best practices.
